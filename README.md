# ZIO Quickstart HTTPS

A simple HTTPS server with one endpoint.

Before running the server, first run the _makecert.sh_ script, which will put a
_server.crt_ and _server.key_ file in _src/main/resources_, generated by the
`openssl` command.

In one terminal, cd into the source directory and run:

```
sbt "project api; run"
```

In another terminal, do this to have curl call the endpoint, allowing
self-signed cert:

```
curl -k https://localhost:8080/ping
```

If you omit the `-k` argument to `curl`, then you will get an error from `curl`
and the server will log an SSL handshake error.
